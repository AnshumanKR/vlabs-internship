* Abstract
  To meet the needs of colleges without adequate laboratory facilities, Virtual
  Labs provides online lab simulations. Many of the labs and associated
  animations are created using Flash. Some of the labs are built with
  JavaScript. Using Flash-based labs provides compatibility issues and hence,
  conversion of these labs is a dire necessity. In this project, we have converted
  the majority of the experiments in the Molecular Absorption Spectroscopy Lab
  (made by IIIT Hyderabad) using pure Javascript. We have also explored two major
  tools that could be used for similar lab building to make the entire process
  easier. We have alos come across, but not explored in depth various other
  online frameworks and tools that can be used to do the same.
* Acknowledgements
  We would like to acknowledge the guidance given to us by Professor Venkatesh
  Chopella of IIIT Hyderabad. He has been key in steering us in the right
  direction by suggesting paths of exploration as well as helping us understand
  the relevance of what we were doing. We would also like to thank the mentors at
  VLEAD for making our life simple and helping us understand basics of Linux and
  Git.
